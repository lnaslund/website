The College of Engineering at The University of Alabama (UA) is seeking outstanding applicants for multiple tenure/tenure-track faculty positions at all ranks and in all areas of engineering that complement and enhance our major water initiatives sponsored by NOAA and USGS. These initiatives are advancing the next generation of hydrologic modeling and water observation systems with emerging opportunities in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and decision science. The following research areas are priorities for the search:

Large-scale Water Modeling — Driven by the challenge of intensifying hydroclimate extremes, there is a need to improve the delivery of actionable water intelligence and the response of decision-makers for national-level forecasting of streamflow, floods, droughts and water quality. This position requires application of large-scale hydrologic modeling with specialization in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, remote sensing and cloud computing.

Hydroinformatics — Motivated by the expansion of data acquisition systems and the need for managing and using massive datasets, this position requires specialization in information systems and technology for water management, engineering and operations, with expertise in extreme data management, analytics, data mining, large dataset access, remote sensing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, water systems modeling and geographic information systems. The ideal candidate will align with needs for research in design and development of water databases, derived data products, middleware, web portals and software contributing to open-source development, FAIR data principles, and the needs of a diverse water sector.

Big Data and Advanced Computing — The data revolution is leading to exciting opportunities at the interface of computer science, data science and domain science. This position seeks applicants with demonstrated excellence innovating new computational and machine learning approaches for large-scale modeling applications. We are interested in applicants with research interests and expertise bridging computer science, data-driven modeling, and process-based modeling of hydrologic systems for improving streamflow, flood, drought, or water quality forecasting.

Sensor Technologies and Observation Systems — This position requires specialization in applied hydrologic sciences including water quality with expertise in field studies applying Internet of Things (IoT) concepts using sensing technologies, wireless sensor networks and robots. The ideal candidate will align with the rapid digitalization of the water sector that is driving research in smart systems, real-time control and edge computing.
