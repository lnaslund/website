Join us at [Triple Bottom Brewing](https://triplebottombrewing.com/) on Monday, June 3rd at 5:30-7:30 for a chapter meeting and social. 

To keep logistics simple, we are planning on selling drink tickets ($10 for students, $20 for non-students) that would equal 2-3 drinks. The plan is to have a quick chapter meeting at the start and then have time to catch up and mingle. Weâ€™re looking forward to seeing everyone in Philly!
