DFP is a special hiring program the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) uses to diversify their workforce. FWS measures DFP’s success by how well they attract students to a summer Fellowship and convert them to full-time, permanent positions. Their goal is to hire all Fellows into permanent employment.

The DFP is for students interested in conservation careers and positions that support the FWS mission to work with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. In prior years, positions included work on species conservation planning, field surveys and monitoring for species, landscape-scale conservation partnerships, environmental law and policy, education and outreach, community engagement, digital communications, and other areas that support FWS’ mission.

Selected students participate in a paid 12-week summer Fellowship program with a week-long orientation and 11 weeks of 40-hour work in remote or in-person positions, as designated in each position description. Upon successful completion of the Fellowship program, along with degree conferral, participants may be directly hired or appointed to full-time, permanent positions without competition.

Applications are due January 13th. For more information, visit http://manoproject.org/fwsdfp.
