The Freshwater Protection Specialist supports the development and implementation of a key global strategy at TNC: Durable Freshwater Protection (DFP). They may develop and implement one or more DFP mechanisms (e.g. free-flowing river designations, protected areas and other effective area-based conservation mechanisms, community-based reserves), through global work and in partnership with colleagues and partners in geographies around the world where TNC works. The Specialist supports Global DFP leadership by assisting with and/or managing priority projects and serves as a technical resource on DFP, including in the areas of policy, conservation planning, strategy development, sustainable financing, stakeholder engagement, capacity development, and/or measurement.  They liaise with other TNC staff, notably field colleagues and other Global Protect colleagues working on Project Finance for Permanence and Nature Bonds, as well as external actors as applicable, to help drive the implementation of the DFP strategy and associated projects in the places where TNC works.  They track and/or assess governmental policies and decisions, or the practices or views of other stakeholders concerning freshwater protections and their potential impact on organizational conservation goals.  They may advise TNC communications, marketing and philanthropy staff on issues related to DFP or priority project(s) and related issues. May involve domestic and international travel of 25% or more.
