**Background**: Many Alabamians still live without reliable access to clean and running water or a functioning sewage system. This is especially true in the Black Belt region where an estimated 30% of homes lack functioning waste sanitation services, according to a recent presentation from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). One viable solution for communities to improve access to clean water and wastewater sanitation is to apply for funding available through ADEM’s State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan program, recently bolstered by an influx of fundings through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. However, applying for ADEM’s SRF program is complicated and can prove insurmountable for many rural, small, or otherwise disadvantaged communities to access funding. The Alabama Rivers Alliance needs a dedicated researcher to help us analyze the current water and wastewater resources available to disadvantaged communities, help determine how effective the state’s programs are currently meeting those needs, and help us identify strategies and policies for advocating improvements to these programs. 

This fellowship will be a contract position paying a total of $10,000, or the equivalent of $20 an hour for approximately 500 hours of work. The timing of the position is negotiable, with options to be full time for three (3) months or part time for six (6) months.  The research conducted will support the water and wastewater infrastructure advocacy work of the Alabama Rivers Alliance and its partner organizations working to ensure accessible and equitable water and wastewater infrastructure funding for communities across Alabama, especially in Alabama’s Black Belt region. This position is designed to work remotely with a defined start and end date and will include regular meetings with ARA staff to discuss project goals, progress, and deliverables. Some travel will be required so it is preferred that applicants have a valid driver’s license and access to reliable transportation.
The Alabama Rivers Alliance is a statewide network of organizations working to protect and restore all of Alabama’s water resources through building partnerships, empowering citizens, and advocating for sound water policy and its enforcement. The Alabama Rivers Alliance is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit funded solely by individuals, like-minded businesses, organizations and private foundations.
