Are you a science graduate student interested in the intersection between policy and science? ESA invites you to apply for the 2023 Graduate Student Policy Award (GSPA).

Offered each year, this award gives graduate students hands-on training and science policy experience including interacting with congressional decision-makers, federal agency officials, and ecologists who work in the science and public policy arena.

Many past recipients are currently working in public policy and many view the ESA GSPA as a stepping-stone to policy fellowship such as the AAAS Fellowship or the NOAA Knauss fellowship. Other past recipients pursue a research career, but they find the public policy knowledge gained from the experience provides a foundation for interacting with policymakers.

ESA plans to hold the event onsite in its Washington, DC office April 24, 25. Awardees must be able to travel to Washington, DC and there is no virtual option. ESA may need to cancel or reschedule the event due to unforeseen circumstance that are related to the pandemic.

Applications are due 11:59 pm EDT Jan. 1, 2023.[Click here for more info](https://www.esa.org/public-policy/get-involved/esa-graduate-student-policy-award/?utm_source=Informz&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=ESA&_zs=Ruj4m&_zl=80hL2)
