summary: Oak Ridge National Laboratory is seeking several Postdoctoral Research Associates who will support the Biogeochemical Dynamics Group in the Environmental Sciences Division (ESD), Biological and Environmental Systems Science Directorate (BESSD) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). We are interested in qualified candidates who can apply their creativity and skills in aquatic biogeochemistry and/or ecology to advance a predictive understanding of how and why watershed hydro-biogeochemical processes (esp. stream metabolism) operate under a range of hydrologic regimes and vary within and across stream networks that drain heterogeneous land covers.

**JOB DESCRIPTION**  

The selected candidates will have responsibility for collaboratively leading field and/or mesocosm investigations to resolve controls on stream metabolism and associated measures of stream function from patch to network scales in watersheds with heterogeneous land cover. Specific research areas include evaluating the resistance and resilience of stream metabolism to disturbance, the response of metabolic communities and emergent patterns to variable inputs associated with dynamic connectivity of the stream network, and (a)synchrony in emergent metabolic regimes along stream networks. This work will be caried out in close collaboration with related research to understand how network connectivity and solute export respond to variable saturation in non-perennial headwaters, and predictively model watershed hydro-biogeochemical function.

The selected candidates will be expected to perform local and regional field work to collect environmental samples, conduct controlled mesocosm experiments, develop and maintain environmental sensors in field and mesocosm settings, and analyze geochemical properties of environmental samples in the laboratory. 

Additional responsibilities will include maintaining detailed scientific records, analyzing experimental data, presenting results within the research group and at national and international conferences, and preparing manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

The nature of our scientific work is highly multidisciplinary, and candidates will work closely with a cohort of empiricists, modelers, and technical professionals from a variety of scientific backgrounds, including hydrology, geochemistry, microbiology, and related fields. All staff and external collaborators are expected to contribute to maintaining a safe work environment in compliance with safety guidelines and promoting a constructive and respectful work environment.

Deliver ORNL’s mission by aligning behaviors, priorities, and interactions with our core values of Impact, Integrity, Teamwork, Safety, and Service. Promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility by fostering a respectful workplace – in how we treat one another, work together, and measure success.
