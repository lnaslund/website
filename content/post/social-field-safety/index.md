title: Social Field Safety Workshop SE SFS 2023
---

The Southeast USA Chapter of SFS teamed up with field safety nonprofit [Field Inclusive](https://www.fieldinclusive.org/) to deliver a social field safety workshop at our 2023 chapter meeting. 

Field Inclusive's definition of Social Field Safety:

"At-risk individuals include minority identities of the following: race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity and/or religion. When individuals from these backgrounds enter unfamiliar communities in the course of fieldwork, they may be placed in an uncomfortable and potentially unsafe ‘othered’ position, and prejudice may manifest against them."

We had four amazing panelists discuss their experiences in the field.

We had 90 workshop participants engage in an interactive scenarios exercise developed with Field Inclusive. Over 75% of participants reported that the workshop increased their confidence to handle social field safety issues. 

Our [workshop handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEBrDMHxlNws5v1-uUFSVjTI_RLKXawoCuBi9x4Wbso/edit?usp=sharing) is accessible to anyone and includes a guided reflection for developing safe field practices, resources for field workers to ask of their supervisors, and links to learn more.
