The AGU Congressional Science Fellowship program places highly qualified and accomplished scientists, engineers, and other professionals in the office of an individual member of Congress or on a committee for a one-year assignment.

The program allows our federal government to more effectively use scientific knowledge and provides scientists with the opportunity to make significant contributions to public policy during their time on Capitol Hill.

For four decades, AGU Congressional Science Fellows (CSFs) have been directly involved in water policy, climate research, energy conservation, and a range of other science-based issues. AGU CSFs have gone on to pursue a wide range of careers from positions in government, both in Congress and at federal agencies, to research positions at academic institutions

Applications for the 2023-2024 fellowship will close January 15 2023. [Click here](https://www.agu.org/Share-and-Advocate/Share/Policymakers/Congressional-Science-Fellowship) for more information
