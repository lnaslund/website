Join us on the Gulf Coast at the beautiful Perdido Beach Resort in Orange Beach, AL for the [2024 Alabama Water Resources Conference (ALWRC)](https://aaes.auburn.edu/wrc/extension-outreach2/annual-alabama-water-resources-conference/) from September 4-6, 2024 hosted by the [Auburn University Water Resources Center](https://aaes.auburn.edu/wrc/)! 

The ALWRC is a forum for all participants of the water resources community, providing opportunities for conversation about the many multidisciplinary aspects of water resources, and making connections that will improve how we understand the complex water issues that are of importance to this state, the region, and the nation. 


Day 1 includes a half-day Symposium from the Alabama Chapter of the American Water Resources Association featuring a “Water Connectivity” theme that includes speakers from the Nature Conservancy, U.S. Geological Survey, Westervelt Company, and the University of Alabama Department of Biological Sciences. The evening includes an offsite social at the infamous Flora-Bama. 
 

Day 2 and 3 feature Keynote speakers Mark Masters of the Georgia Water Planning and Policy Center at Albany State University and John Kvach of the Singing River Trail, concurrent oral and lightning talk sessions, a poster session and social, and ample networking opportunities. Concurrent oral sessions offer opportunities to engage in water-related issues such as Aquatic Ecology, Agriculture/Irrigation, Coastal Issues, Drought & Climate, Emerging Contaminants, GIS, Groundwater, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), Infrastructure, Modeling & Water Management, Recreation, Tourism & Philanthropy, Reservoir Shoreline Management, Restoration, Stormwater, Wastewater Systems Management, Water & Energy Management, Water Law & Policy, Water Monitoring, Water Quality, Water Quantity, Water Security/Risk, and more.
