## Research Grant

Applications are now open and will be accepted until February 1, 2023.

One Field Inclusive Research Grant in the amount of $500 will be awarded to an applicant to help support natural science field work. Grants can be used towards equipment purchases, field housing, transportation, or technician salary.

Upon completion of the work, willingness to provide a photograph and brief write-up about what the award was used towards for the webpage is also a condition. Applicants may also be asked to present during a future #FieldInclusiveWeek.

**Complete Proposal Guidelines and Criteria are available [here](https://www.fieldinclusive.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/FI-Research-Grant-Application-2023.pdf).**

An applicant can only be awarded one Field Inclusive Research Grant throughout their lifetime.

Applicants are asked to submit their proposals via email to fieldinclusive@gmail.com.

The Field Inclusive Team intends to select recipients and inform all applicants of the outcome by mid-March. 

Please contact us at fieldinclusive@gmail.com with any further questions.
