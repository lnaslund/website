The Coosa River Swim Guide is a weekly bacteriological monitoring program that answers the simple question,“Is it safe to swim?” Jumping into your favorite swimming hole during the summer should be the easiest decision you make all year.That’s why we dedicate our Thursdays & Fridays from Memorial. Day until Labor Day to test water quality at the Coosa’s most popular places to swim! Because, no one should have to gamble with their health when it comes to splashing in the river.Through this program, we protect public health, execute best practices in the field and in the lab, and improve water quality—all while having a good time!

**Fish Guide Internships (4 available)**
The Fish Guide Interns work directly with the Field Coordinator to plan and carry out the 2023  Choccolocco Creek Creel Survey. A creel survey is a Q&A style form that asks those who fish on Choccolocco Creek about their fishing and eating habits. This involves planning the survey trips, going to local fishing spots, interviewing the anglers about their fishing habits, and inputting this data into a spreadsheet. The Creel Survey will take place in-person from May to September. Additionally, the Fish  Guide Interns provide crucial support with outreach and communications about the survey itself  including content creation, photo opportunities, and social media outreach.
