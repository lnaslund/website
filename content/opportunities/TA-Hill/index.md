The Jim Hill Diversity Fellowship program honors the contributions of one of the Tennessee Aquarium’s pioneering
leaders, who advocated for diversity in all areas of the Aquarium’s work.
The Jim Hill Diversity Fellowship is an 11‐week, work‐based learning opportunity at the Tennessee Aquarium in
Chattanooga, Tennessee. Its purpose is to help address the demographic disparities within conservation science careers by providing experience and equitable access to populations that have been historically underrepresented in these fields. This experience will help guide and empower conservation‐minded students to develop solutions to complex conservation challenges in our communities and gain valuable hands‐on work experience.  

The Tennessee Aquarium’s history of providing students the opportunity to work and study alongside its staff has shown that such professional experience reveals new career options for students from all walks of life. Selected Fellows will be paid a $14.00 hourly wage along with campus housing and parking. The Fellowship period is May 15 to July 28, 2023, and fellows must be available for the full 11 weeks.

Jim Hill Conservation Fellows will be exposed to several aspects of freshwater conservation science with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute team.  Areas include conservation aquaculture for reintroduction biology, field biology surveying endangered species, lab analysis to understand emerging threats to aquatic ecosystems, and translating scientific concepts for educational audiences. This hands‐on opportunity will offer students an increased understanding of concepts in freshwater biology, ichthyology, and aquatic biodiversity conservation. Fellows will focus primarily on lab/field research or the propagation and care of rare native fishes.

Key Responsibilities:
- Perform conservation duties which may include care of animals in reintroduction programs, fieldwork on
southeastern rivers and streams, and data collection in laboratory settings.
- Maintain appropriate logs and records for data collection.
- Interact with staff, volunteers, and the public professionally and ethically.

Key Requirements:
- College student with a science major
- Able to commit to the full internship of 11 weeks.
- Able to climb ladders, lift and carry 50 lbs.
- Show a high interest in science, conservation, or education.
- Able to withstand outdoor conditions in the summer season.
- Responsible for own transportation from campus housing to the Conservation Institute (approx.10‐min drive)

Seasonal, hourly; 40 hours/week from May 15 to July 28 (must be available for all 11 weeks); weekend and holiday work may be required; Fellowship includes University of Tennessee at Chattanooga campus housing & campus parking.

Interested candidates are asked to apply online through the Aquarium’s INTERNAL career site at
tnaqua.applicantpro.com/internaljobs/. Please be prepared to upload a resume, cover letter, and unofficial transcripts during the application process.

All submissions must be received by Friday, March 31, at 5:00 PM (EST).
