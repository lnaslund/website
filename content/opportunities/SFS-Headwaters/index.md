The Headwaters Leadership Academy administered by the Society for Freshwater Science is seeking early-career freshwater scientists for its 2023 cohort. 

The mission of the Headwaters Leadership Academy is to build a pipeline for emerging leaders by forming a network of early career freshwater scientists and providing mentorship, service, and professional development opportunities beyond the typical training offered in traditional academic settings.

The Headwaters Leadership Academy is a two-year commitment from September to May of each year that requires mandatory participation in three components:

1. Professional Development – attendance at 8 interactive presentations (4/year); 1.5 hr each 
2. Mentoring Program – participation in monthly discussions; 1 hr each; groups of 2 mentors and 2-3 mentees
3. Society Service – participation in an SFS committee or other society service

All applicants must be either in the last year of their intended terminal degree or less than 5 years since their terminal degree was awarded, and must be (or become) members of the Society for Freshwater Science. The selection criteria prioritize creating a cohort with diverse perspectives and experiences by representing varying career stages, career types, and demographics. A personal statement from each applicant describing their expectations and goals for this program is required as part of this application and will be also considered during the selection process. The personal statement should NOT include a description of your research. You can view the assessment rubric for the personal statement [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fz2xuWoGwJdnpBULNHdxy0MZyDuvPEco/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true).
