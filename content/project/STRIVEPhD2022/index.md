**Position Description:**

The [Streams, Rivers, and Estuaries (STRIVE) Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/strivelab/opportunities?authuser=0) at [Clemson University’s Belle W. Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/research/baruch/) is seeking a PhD student to work on a newly funded NOAA-NIDIS project. Working with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe of northern Idaho, this effort focuses on the potential for restored riverine/floodplain wetlands to mitigate the effects of drought and to enhance tribal beneficial uses. As a student in the [Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/forestry-environmental-conservation/index.html), the individual will be based at Clemson University but will travel to the Coeur d’Alene Reservation for fieldwork and project collaboration. Applicants must have completed and defended their MSc by August 2023 and be available for fieldwork starting June 2023. Interested applicants should submit a cover letter, C.V. (including undergraduate and graduate GPA), and the names and contact information for three references. Applicants representing a diversity of backgrounds and eager to support ongoing efforts to broaden participation in science are encouraged to apply. Open until filled. For more information or to apply, contact Dr. Mažeika Patricio Sulliván: mazeiks@clemson.edu.
