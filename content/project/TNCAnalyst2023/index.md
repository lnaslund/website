The Freshwater Protection Spatial Analyst will promote the development and implementation of a key global strategy at TNC: Durable Freshwater Protection (DFP). The Analyst will directly support Global DFP leadership by assisting with and/or managing priority projects and serving as a technical resource on DFP in the areas of conservation planning, stakeholder engagement, data development, spatial analysis, and measurement. They will liaise with other TNC staff, notably field colleagues and other Global Protect colleagues working on the Nature Bond and Enduring Earth: Project Finance for Permanence initiatives, as well as external actors as applicable, to help drive the implementation of the DFP strategy and associated projects in the places where TNC works. Their primary focus will be on delivery of freshwater spatial analysis and conservation planning for specific projects around the world; they may also support development of global or regional datasets, indices, tools, and measurement approaches. Additionally, they may assist TNC communications, marketing, and philanthropy staff with spatial analysis and mapping. This position is likely to involve domestic and international travel of 25% or more.
