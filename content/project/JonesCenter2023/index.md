**Summary** The position will begin in March 2023 for an initial term of 6 months, with the possibility of extension. The Ecohydrology Lab conducts research focused on the intersection of upland longleaf pine forest dynamics and hydrology at local and regional scales. The employee’s primary duties will center on routine field work and sample processing. Duties will include: 1) collecting forest structure measurements; 2) construction, installation and maintenance of sap flow probes and meteorological sensors; 3) frequent, routine measurements of throughfall and leaf area; 4) data collection from and maintenance of wetland HOBO sensors; and 5) data entry. Additionally, there will be an option to be trained in tree canopy access and sensor installation. The 28,500-acre research center is located in southwestern Georgia between Albany and Bainbridge. The Center’s research, education, and conservation programs focus on ecology and natural resource management. The site includes 16,000 acres of longleaf pine forests, over 1,000 acres of wetlands, and 26 miles of stream and river ecosystems.
