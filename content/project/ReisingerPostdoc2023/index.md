The Reisinger lab at the University of Florida is recruiting a postdoctoral associate to come join the NSF (DISES) Funded "People and Ponds" project investigating how social perceptions influence urban pond management, and how those management changes affect biogeochemical and algal community dynamics, ultimately feeding back onto the community through shifts in property values and other economic impacts. Additional details can be found in the attached PDF and are available on the [lab website](https://ajreisingerlab.weebly.com/post-doc-position.html). 

This position will lead up field work focused on pond metabolism, denitrification, and DOM dynamics. This person will have opportunities to develop add-on projects depending on their expertise and the progress being made on the project. There will also be opportunities for mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. The starting salary for the position is $50,000 plus benefits for a two year appointment, with a potential renewal for a third year assuming that progress is satisfactory.
