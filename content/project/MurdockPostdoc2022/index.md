A postdoctoral research position is available at The Center for the Management, Utilization and Protection of Water Resources at Tennessee Tech University. The successful candidate will work with a team of ecologists, hydrologists, and modelers studying harmful algal bloom (HAB) development and toxin production in flowing waters, focusing on the Ohio River. This position will lead cyanobacterial physiology research investigating how distinct riverine physical, chemical, and biological parameters promote cell growth and trigger toxin production. These data will be used to help the larger research group parametrize a riverine HAB prediction model for the Ohio River, and gain more general understanding of HAB development and persistence in flowing waters. 

This work is part of a multi-university project providing opportunities to collaborate with other researchers at partner institutions to produce multidisciplinary research products integrating algal ecology, river and watershed hydrology, and computer modeling. Specifically, this position will design and conduct laboratory and field-based algal/cyanobacterial bioassays investigating HAB growth and physiology from cellular to community levels. This position is also required to write and submit peer reviewed publications; present research at local, regional, national, and/or international meetings, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students on the project. Mentoring will also be available for the postdoc to further develop grant writing skills and submit additional research proposals as desired. 

**Qualifications** We are seeking a highly motivated individual with advanced knowledge of algal ecology and physiology, stream ecology and/or biogeochemistry, and excellent quantitative, written, and oral communication skills. Required qualifications include a Ph.D. in aquatic ecology, biology/microbiology, biochemistry or a similar field, with the ability to work well with a team and individually. It is preferred that the candidate have experience in algal/cyanobacteria identification, water quality analysis, experimental design, and a solid statistical background. Additional knowledge of ecotoxicology, stable isotopes, and advanced analytical techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and algal toxin analysis is also beneficial, but not required. 

**Salary and duration**: $50-55K per year plus benefits. The position is for one year with the opportunity to extend up to three years based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. The position start date is negotiable, but is available immediately. 

Tennessee Tech https://www.tntech.edu/ has a particularly strong fisheries and aquatic ecology program, and has substantial aquatic and hydrology research conducted through Tennessee Techâ€™s Center for the Management, Utilization, and Protection of Water Resources https://www.tntech.edu/watercenter. The University is situated in Cookeville, Tennessee in the scenic rolling hills of the Upper Cumberland region, which is known for exceptional outdoor recreational opportunities. More information about the area is available at https://visitcookevilletn.com/. 

Applications should include a cover letter, CV, unofficial transcripts, and contact information for two references. Please email application materials or questions about the position to Justin Murdock at jmurdock@tntech.edu.
