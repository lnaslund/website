Register for Spring 2025 Southeast Chapter Conference as part of Georgia Water Resources, March 25-26

The call for special session proposals for the meeting has just been released and are due [November 1st](https://rivercenter.uga.edu/propose-a-session/). We hope many of our members will consider submitting a session. We've already heard from some of you! If you're thinking about organizing a special session, we encourage you to assess interest from other SE SFS members. If you identify 3-5 people who are interested in attending and presenting their work, please go ahead and submit your proposal. Feel free to reach out to other chapter members to encourage their participation!
  
When submitting your session, please include "SESFS" in the title (e.g., SESFS: Bivalve Ecology and Conservation). This helps in two ways: first, it gives us a sense of how many SESFS members plan to attend the meeting, and second, it allows us to promote a subset of sessions specifically to our membership.

After the sessions are submitted, we plan to remove the "SESFS" tag from the title while keeping the rest of the session name intact. This will encourage participation from non-SESFS members, potentially growing our community.
