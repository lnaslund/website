# Southeast Chapter Meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science (2025)

The Southeast Chapter of the Society for Freshwater Science warmly invites its members to attend the upcoming chapter meeting, which will be held in conjunction with [the Georgia Water Resources Conference](https://rivercenter.uga.edu/georgia-water-resources-conference/). This event will take place in Athens, Georgia, on March 25–26, 2025, and promises to offer valuable networking, academic, and professional development opportunities, especially for undergraduate and graduate students!

**Event Overview**

The decision to align this year’s meeting with the Georgia Water Resources Conference reflects the chapter’s commitment to leveraging regional infrastructure and fostering collaboration among freshwater science professionals.

**Registration Information**

To participate, members are required to [register](https://rivercenter.uga.edu/registration/) through the Georgia Water Resources Conference. Registration includes access to all conference sessions and activities.

Early-bird registration fees (ends February 14th):

Regular registration: $240

Student registration: $90

**Presentations**

Members are encouraged to [submit abstracts](https://rivercenter.uga.edu/submit-an-abstract/) for presentation in either special sessions or regular sessions offered by the Georgia Water Resources Conference. These presentations will serve as a platform for showcasing the contributions of the chapter’s members, including students. Thank you to those that submitted special sessions for SE SFS including freshwater science in the Southeast, Aquatic Microbial Ecology and critical data needed for mussel conservation. You will have the opportunity to indicate in your abstract submission if you are a member of SE SFS.

In late January/early February, we will send a form to our members to confirm whether they will attend the meeting, either as presenters or as participants who do not plan to present. This will help us better understand the total number of attendees.


**Chapter Meeting and Social Events**

The chapter meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of March 25, the first day of the conference. This timing will hopefully allow members to participate in the larger conference activities while also attending the chapter business meeting. Our chapter meeting will occur right before social event organized by the Georgia Water Resources Conference.

## Leadership and Future Planning

A major topic of discussion during the chapter meeting will be its future leadership. Current leaders, Carla Atkinson and Krista Capps, are planning to stay through 2025, and the chapter will hold elections for President and Secretary later in 2025. The newly elected officers will begin their terms in 2026.

These leadership roles are excellent opportunities for early-career professionals, particularly those pursuing tenure or promotions, to gain valuable experience. The chapter also plans to implement a past-president model, to support the new leaders. We are especially excited to welcome leadership from outside academia!

**Questions and Contact Information**

Members with questions about the Georgia Water Resources Conference itself are encouraged to contact the conference organizers. For inquiries related to chapter-specific events or participation, members can reach out directly to [Krista Capps](kcapps@uga.edu).
